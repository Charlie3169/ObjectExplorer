            <h1>Education</h1>
            <p>
                    Once the universal language has been developed and assuming it has been well constructed, I believe this could become the next frontier of education. 
                We would have a language that intuitively breaks down all concepts down to their first principles, and is able to convey its ideas much faster than traditional language. 
                The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is the theory that language shapes and influences our cognition (this is the same as the lensing I was talking about earlier), and if this is truly the case then what better way to utilize this property than with a highly intuitive, mathematically rigorous semantic language. 
                It could completely change the way people see and think about the world, and its users may find learning things faster, making new connections between ideas, and thinking in entirely new ways. 
                Get to people young enough and you may even see lifelong increases in creativity and intelligence. It could lead to a renaissance across science and society as a whole as people begin to integrate it into their thinking and start to see the world in completely new ways. 
                All of this is of course assuming that a highly optimal configuration of the semantic language can be found (which hopefully the system should be able to converge on through training and feedback) and that the hard limit of cognition for the human brain is far enough away from natural language that there is still merit to try and break past it.

            </p>

            <p>
                    If the functional side of semantic language is sufficiently developed and a universal programming language (which would attempt to alias all statements in all languages into implementations) is reached, it would be possible for software development to be both automated by the system and accessible to everyone via mapping natural language straight to functionality. 
                In addition, there is no reason the internet would have to remain anything like it is in its current form. 
                It could become much more like a collaborative dream world, where peopleâ€™s thoughts can be brought to life instantly from simple commands. 
                Programs and background processes or anything with functionality could be visually displayed and animated as part of the environment itself, 
                allowing the user to gain an intuitive understanding of what is happening around them. Because there would be financial incentive to develop the platform, over time the internet could be transformed into something closer to an MMO game rather than the browser view we currently have.

            </p>
            
            <h1>The Technological Singularity</h1>
            <p>
                    As the system collects data, ideas, computational resources, and functionalities through its user base (which are all semantically addressed) and evaluates them by their usefulness, it increasingly becomes worth more than the sum of its parts. 
                Any given problem has some set of actions which if carried out would be the most effective solution, and over time these competencies will be found. 
                Because everything is semantically addressed it can allow for narrow competencies to be converted into more general ones and utilized across the system, which could lead to the creation of an artificial general intelligence, rather than the narrow AI we currently have.
