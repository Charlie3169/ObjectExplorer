            <h1>Natural Semantic Metalanguage</h1>
            <p> 
                    Semantics is a subfield of linguistics that studies meaning. 
                In any language, each word carries some meaning associated with it, linking it to a concept or idea. 
                Natural semantic metalanguage is the term for a linguistic theory that attempts to reduce a language’s lexicon down to a set of semantic primes. 
                In the same way that all numbers can be broken down and factored into a unique combination of primes, the same is true for words and their meaning. 
                You can think of these semantic primes as atoms of language, with words being molecules made from them.
            </p>

            <p>
                    Indra’s Net is an ancient metaphor of the universe and the nature of reality. 
                Imagine a space, infinite in dimension, filled with an infinite amount of spheres. 
                Each of the spheres are perfectly reflective and contain on their surfaces the reflection of all other spheres, which in turn reflect all other spheres, ad infinitum. 
                All points within this system touch all other points. In more modern terms you would call this an infinite complete graph. 
                Subsets of this architecture show up all over the place in information technology, from the internet and links between its pages, network topologies, neural networks, and graph databases.

            <h1>Indra’s Net + Semantic Language = Akashic Records</h1>
            <p>
                    Combining these two concepts creates a semantic space, where your position within it maps to a unique semantic meaning. 
                Each node represents a separate dimension (more accurately a direction in vector-space), and every node is just a linear combination of other nodes (aside from the semantic prime nodes). 
                This would be the foundation for the Akasha system as a whole.

                The Akashic Records is an esoteric concept that is defined as a compendium of all 
                human events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intent ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future, and that is exactly what is created at the intersection of these two concept nodes.

            <h1>Universal Digital Language</h1>            
            <p>
                    Language has existed in its current form for at least 60,000 years. 
                Starting with spoken words and later written words, the way we communicate has been fundamentally the same. 
                It has been calculated that all spoken languages tend towards an information transmission rate of 39 bits-per-second, with their written variants coming at around 50 bits-per-second, but could it be possible to increase these rates? 
                Could the bandwidth and throughput of language be increased by using more sensory and conceptual channels at once and using modern technology as the medium to do it? 
                Using different symbols, visual associations, sounds, colors, shapes, and animations could an intuitive language be developed that is capable of downloading information to its users? 
                Each word should be as unique and information dense as possible, as well as be displayed in such a way that its meaning can be visually derived from its constituent parts. 
                Because there are so many possible decisions to be made when creating a language like this, development should be largely open source and democratic so that the best methods can be found in order to properly execute its creation.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Hyper Perspectivism</h1>
            <p>
                    One of the properties of a semantic language is that it reduces all points of view to a location within semantic space. 
               Therefore, by definition you can derive logical conclusions of thoughts, ideas, and perspectives by the linear combinations of each point involved. 
               For example, if I have the point that represents some idea with all of its properties and associations (defined as abstract as possible) and I combine it with another point, the bonding of these two points should produce their conceptual sum. 
               An example could be the opinions of two people on some issue. Each person has their own cloud of points that represent their opinion, which are built up from their core beliefs, personal biases, and the reasoning built from those ideas. 
               When one person views the other's opinion, their perspective is lensed by their own beliefs and affects how the others ideas are understood, and this unique perspective is equivalent to the linear combination of both and their dot product would have the similarity of two ideas 
               (And I’m sure there are a lot more interesting relationships in linear algebra,  calculus, and other math to explore within semantic space that are outside the scope of my knowledge). 
               Anyway, when this idea of lensing is applied to the whole of the system, the idea of seeing all ideas from all possible perspectives, we can really start to reap the benefits of this model. 
            </p>
            
            <h1>Akashic Generation and Mapping</h1>
            <figure>

            <p>
                    Akashic mapping is the process of exploring complexity and systematically documenting it. 
                As the system becomes more defined and accumulates more data, it can begin to systematically explore adjacent points and novel semantic combinations and ask questions about them, a kind of chemistry of ideas. 
                The points that prove to be valid and useful can then influence the system’s intuition on what and where to map, creating a feedback loop of data discovery. 
                This process can be applied to any conceptual field and used to potentially develop it and innovate within it. 
                For example, if you have a well defined ontology representing math and all its concepts, their properties, and their relations to each other, could you not mix and match each of those points to create entirely new math or notice relationships previously unnoticed? 
                Could you not do this with any science? This process should be applied to all areas within the system, to continually develop and expand the system’s competencies and overall effectiveness. 
            </p>

            <p>
                    Another subset of semantic space is the space of functions and operations that can be performed, which is largely the domain of programming languages. 
                This means that the system itself can be mapped within semantic space and iterated on in the same way as the concepts above. 
                It also means we could potentially create a universal programming language. If all programming languages can be mapped semantically, 
                then you can use this property to represent all languages and existing code inside one homoiconic language that can translate between all of them. 
                Having a language like this could be of great benefit to computer science as a whole, as well as allowing the Akasha system to take in existing programs as data to facilitate its own development.

            <h1>Digital Marketplace of Data, Computational Work, and Ideas</h1>
            <p>               
                    For each piece of data or computational work contributed to the system a stock is given out as a reward. 
                The initial value of that stock is determined dynamically based on the demand of that type of data as well as it’s uniqueness and changes with time as that set of data proves its usefulness to the system. 
                This encourages data contribution and development of the platform that scales as the platform grows, potentially creating a feedback loop of progress in the system. 
                Any currency awarded can be traded back to the system and its members and exchanged for any other services or objects within the system, creating a digital economy of information and computational services that can be utilized by the system as a whole to facilitate its growth.

            <h1>Machine Learning and Cellular Automata</h1>
            <p>
                    For any given task, there exists some point within semantic space that maps to the most effective way to complete that task. 
                Within the space of all possible programs we can generate cellular automata that live within the semantic environment. 
                Each one would be sensitive to different things and have different actions to perform at different tolerances. 
                We can then use natural selection on them to continually iterate upon them and refine their effectiveness at a given task. 
                These automata would be the main driver of the system's intelligence and its ability to discover useful information, and are analogous to the nodes and weights within a neural network. 
                All machine learning models can exist as automata within this space and be organized by their usefulness at different things, and mixed and matched on demand for any given task.
