            <h1>Reaching Critical Mass</h1>
            <figure>

            <p>
                I like to think of this system like a star. 
                When a critical mass (data, computational power, and users) is reached, fusion can begin and energy (valuable work) can be extracted from the system, which in turn will raise the temperature of the star and allow for more fusion to happen. 
                This system can go one of two ways. Either its built in feedback loops can be leveraged enough to create a dynamo of utility which sustains the system’s existence, or it can fizzle out due to lack of users, computational and data contributions, and confidence in its currency. 
                It can either snowball into rapid success or rapid failure. If we want to eventually reach the black hole stage of a star's life (technological singularity) then the system must start strong enough from the beginning to not lose steam on its way to becoming self-sufficient and able to generate value on its own.

            <h1>System Intuition vs Span of Complexity</h1>
            <p>
                As dimensionality increases the the space that needs to be explored within all of possibility grows by O(3^n) (if we only check weights of 1, 0, and -1 for each dimension), 
                so an intuition must be developed that monitors the success of different lines of thought, as well as the relationship of mapping difficulty vs success rate for each dimension in answering questions. 
                Once this is put in place could prevent the system from drowning within the sea of complexity.
            </p>  
            
            <h1>Failure of Universal Language</h1>
            <p>
                It is entirely possible that we will find down the line that a universal language is too difficult to visually create or to learn and be understood. 
                Or that its communication bandwidth is not significantly better than natural language. 
                Regardless, it will still be useful on the computational side of things and the success of Akasha as a whole is nog hinged on the language’s success. 
                It is just a very cool potential application of semantic language.

            </p>  
            
            <h1>Malicious Attacks</h1>
            <p>
                Countermeasures will have to be put into place to defend against many types of malicious attacks, both from within and from the outside. 
                One example could be semantic vandalism, where incorrect information is attributed to an object. 
                Wikipedia deals with a similar problem using version history alongside manual intervention, but long term an automated solution will need to be found. 
                Another example could be a user spoofing their outgoing transmission of whatever node they are hosting for the purpose of gaining unearned currency, 
                and the solution to this would be using hashing and other cryptographic techniques to check for modification.

            </p>  
            
            <h1>Existing Products</h1>
            <p>
                Pretty much every concept discussed so far already has an existing analogue in business and the current IT landscape. 
                Google has already semantically mapped the internet. Wikipedia has already mapped humanity’s knowledge. 
                Cryptocurrencies are already in place, with some even being linked to the things like AI. 
                GitHub is already the place to develop software collaboratively. 
                OpenAI already has an insanely powerful NLP-based AI in GTP-3. 
                The biggest thing that separates Akasha from these existing services is synergy. 
                It allows for everything to be linked together to create as much synergy as possible from as many systems as possible, all under one shared value umbrella. 
                Every piece has the ability to work together with every other piece to help the system grow as a whole.
