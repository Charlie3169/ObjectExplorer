            <h1>Currency Feedback Loops</h1>
            <p>
                    The biggest driver of the system’s growth is the underlying currency linking all of its parts together. 
                The currency allows for the trade of many different services such as data entry, computational resources, system development, human feedback, and the ever increasing capabilities of the system as a whole. 
                Each of these commodities feed into each other and enables them to become more effective, creating a snowball effect in the value of the underlying currency, which then increases the demand of the currency, causing even more contributions to the system. 
                The price of each of these commodities would follow supply and demand, so in the case that there is too much or too little of one of them, market forces can bring the system back into balance.
            </p>        
            
            <h1>Low Overhead Automated Company</h1>
            <p>
                    Since every action on the system has some value associated with it, and it is in the interest of every user that that value goes up, we can outsource the majority of the system’s development to the public. 
                Every user is encouraged to compete as well as cooperate with the rest of the user base to improve the system overall. 
                By creating the company as a worker cooperative and directly tying stock as well as decision power in the company to the system’s currency, it can have access to a large freelance workforce that can be paid in cryptocurrency. 
                The people that would choose to do this at baseline are probably the same people who mine cryptocurrency now or contribute to open source projects for free, but as the system advances and better methods of gamification are found then a more casual audience may begin to contribute as well. 
                Additionally, since computational power is one of the commodities traded within the system, it could enable it to run cheaply as a distributed network.

            </p>    
            
            <h1>Singularity Speculation</h1>
            <p>
                    If there is even a small chance that the collective intelligence of the system could become effective as an AGI someday, then that will retroactively generate interest in it and the value of its currency. 
                This creates a self- fulfilling prophecy with the feedback loops mentioned earlier. 
                The best way to get this ball rolling then would be to do everything in our power to engineer the system so that it could be possible with time and to convince speculators that this has been accomplished.
            </p>    
            
            <h1>Late Game Profits</h1>
            <p>
                    For everything prior to technological singularity occurring within this system, the inherent value of the system’s currency will be negligible, and it will mostly exist off of fiat. 
                But afterward, if there is truly a super intelligence backing its value and this intelligence is controlled by the public, then the possible avenues to generate collective profits across the entire spectrum of business will be nearly infinite.
