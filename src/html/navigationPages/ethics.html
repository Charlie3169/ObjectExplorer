            <h1>Preventing Rogue AI</h1>
            <p>
                There is a high chance that AI would not be strictly benevolent to humanity if left to develop on its own. 
                Therefore levers to control and shape its development will need to be baked into its architecture to ensure that it goes in a positive direction. 
                One advantage of working from semantic space is that the very behaviors that would be of interest to code for or against exist within that space. 
                Therefore, the system could view its own potential actions and thoughts through those lenses and assess its alignment towards them.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Data Privacy</h1>
            <p>
                Akasha is not really interested in personal data (like the kind needed to sell you stuff), but we are interested in human data, information that the system needs to be taught in order to understand and interface with humans. 
                At some point down the line this would also include auto-generated and self-added data that attempts to point to that user’s location within semantic space (core beliefs, opinions, values) for the purposes of optimal communication. 
                Any data that the system does collect would be opt-in, private by default, and visible to the user. Additionally there would a be currency reward for choosing to provide data.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Sharing of the Singularity</h1>
            <p>
                The achievement of the singularity is a turning point for mankind, and whoever would control it would essentially be able to win at capitalism. 
                Rather than the cornucopia of wealth that is AGI be hoarded by some company, it should be used for the benefit of humanity. 
                By tying the company’s value and profits to its own currency, the benefits can be shared with anyone who can contribute ideas and their unique perspective to the system, 
                move the world closer towards an imagination economy, and in the long term could even set the stage for a kind of universal basic income.
